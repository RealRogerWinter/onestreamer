# Socket.IO event reference

_Last verified: 2026-05-23 against commit 4a1d325._

Flat-table reference of every Socket.IO event OneStreamer uses. For grouped-by-feature narrative and the rationale for the two-socket design, see [`/docs/architecture/realtime-events.md`](../architecture/realtime-events.md).

Two sockets per browser:

- **Main socket** (`:8443`, namespace `/`) — streaming, items, points, buffs, effects, game, admin
- **Chat socket** (`:8444`, namespace `/chat/socket.io/`) — messages, votes, claim codes, moderation events

Direction key: **C→S** = client emits, **S→C** = server emits.
